# Lab-8
Our task was based again on the Mesonet text file. The assignment this time was to take one station ID, find out how many 
and which other stations have the same average ASCII value, and to then return that list, and then that list sorted 
alphabetically/ lexicographically.  The key skills to practice with this lab revolve around using Maps, specifically HashMap
and its different methods and uses. We had to input, retrieve, and use the data with a HashMap. I also used a TreeMap, which 
was possible because of its similarity to a HashMap in terms of its methods.
