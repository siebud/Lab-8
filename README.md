# Lab-8
Our task was based again on the Mesonet text file. The assignment this time was to take one station ID, find out how many 
and which other stations have the same average ASCII value, and to then return that list, and then that list sorted 
alphabetically/ lexicographically.  The key skills to practice with this lab revolve around using Maps, specifically HashMap
and its different methods and uses. We had to input, retrieve, and use the data with a HashMap. I also used a TreeMap, which 
was possible because of its similarity to a HashMap in terms of its methods.

To begin this project, I first read though the project description on canvas a couple times until I felt reasonably assured 
about the goal. I then downloaded and read through the given files to understand what to do and how the project would implement 
that, especially related to parent classes and inheritance. I then preceded to construct a skeleton of each class based on its 
name and the information provided in the writeup. After that I went back and read up on the HashMap java API to understand its 
methods better. I started with what I perceived to be the most straightforward task, writing the method for finding the average 
ASCII value of a MesoStation. I started here because we had already had to do the same thing in our previous project, so felt 
most confident there. I then wrote a first draft for the MesoEquals class, utilizing the same BufferedReader solution that I used 
in previous projects. I then wrote a first draft for the StationLexicographical class, which proved quite difficult. After 
that was a lot of trial and error in terns of troubleshooting. During this time, I also went back and forth many times with 
the java API to find an effective way to sort a Map.
